# How Open-Closed Works

## The Simple Version

1. **Morning**: Open web app, set energy, pick tasks, get time-blocked plan
2. **All day**: Widget shows task events, swipe to complete/skip/snooze
3. **Done**: Open web app for more tasks or celebrate

---

## The Two Apps

**Life Manager (Web)** = Your brain
- Set energy level
- Pick today's tasks + add time estimates
- View analytics

**Life Launcher (Android)** = Your hands
- See next task event
- Swipe to act
- Stay focused

---

## The Three Types

1. **Tasks** - Raw to-do items (from Google Tasks, Todoist)
2. **User Events** - Your meetings/appointments (manually in Google Calendar)
3. **Task Events** - Auto-generated by Life Manager (tasks → calendar events)

---

## The Three Gestures

```
→ Swipe RIGHT = Done (task complete)
← Swipe LEFT  = Skip (give me something easier)
↓ Swipe DOWN  = Tomorrow (not today)
```

---

## The Smart Queue

Task events are ordered **hardest first** (eat the frog).

When you skip, you get the **easiest task** instead (quick win).

Complete that easy one? Back to the **hardest** again.

```
Your plan: [Hard] [Medium] [Medium] [Easy]
            ↑ start here

Skip? → Jump to [Easy]
Complete [Easy]? → Back to [Hard]
Skip again? → No more easy ones, try [Medium]
```

You're always working from the ends, never stuck in the middle.

## User Events (Meetings)

Widget always shows your next **task event** at top.

When a **user event** (meeting) is close:

| Time to meeting | What you see |
|-----------------|--------------|
| > 45 min | Task event only |
| 15-45 min | Task event + meeting preview below |
| < 15 min | Meeting takes over |

Complete/skip the meeting → back to task events.

---

## Morning Planning

Life Manager shows you:
1. Today's calendar (your user events)
2. Suggested tasks (sorted by urgency + balance)
3. All pending tasks (scroll down)

You pick tasks, add time estimates, hit "Plan My Day".

Life Manager slots them into gaps between your meetings.

---

## The Daily Cycle

```
Morning:  Web app → Set energy → Pick tasks → Get plan
          ↓
All day:  Widget → Complete/Skip/Snooze task events
          ↓
Meeting:  Widget shows meeting → Complete/Skip → Back to tasks
          ↓
Empty:    Web app → Pick more tasks or celebrate
```

---

## Why It Works

- **Hardest first**: Willpower is highest in the morning
- **Quick wins on skip**: Momentum beats perfection
- **Snooze guilt-free**: Tomorrow is a valid answer
- **Calendar-aware**: Tasks fit around meetings
- **Two apps**: Think in one place, act in another

## One Sentence

> Pick tasks, get them time-blocked around meetings, work hardest to easiest, swipe through your day.
