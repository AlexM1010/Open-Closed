# Product Overview

Life Manager is a local-first personal life-management system built on the Structural Optimism philosophy that integration across life domains creates wellbeing.

## Core Features

- **Domain Balance**: Track tasks across life areas (health, university, admin, relationships, creative projects) with nudges toward neglected domains
- **Energy-Adaptive Planning**: Daily plans that respect energy levels (0-10 scale), adjusting task count and duration
- **Health Tracking**: Log sleep, energy, mood, and medication adherence
- **Streaks & Motivation**: Visual feedback on consistency across domains
- **Safety Guardrails**: Gentle prompts when patterns suggest support is needed
- **Weekly Summaries**: Plain-text reports for sharing with care teams
- **Google Sync**: Optional two-way sync with Google Calendar and Tasks

## Philosophy

Integration creates wellbeing. The system treats relationship and health tasks as genuinely important, not optional. The planning algorithm actively nudges toward balance, respects energy, and surfaces neglected areas honestly.

## Privacy & Safety

- **Local-first**: SQLite database, zero external servers (except optional Google sync)
- **No medical advice**: Tracks adherence only, never suggests medication changes
- **Gentle guardrails**: Recommends reaching out to support when concerning patterns emerge
- **User autonomy**: All data stays on user's machine, can be backed up or deleted anytime
